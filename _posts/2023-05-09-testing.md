## What's even the point of this?
Well, that's a good question. I honestly don't know myself.

These days, it seems like everything that you need to make a site is already there. I could've used Medium, Substack, or whatever. I just wanted to do it "myself." (I used Chirpy and Jekyll, as well as Github Pages) I'm missing half the features by doing this, but y'know... I didn't choose this for the features. Except I did. I have very little clue of what I'm doing. Honestly I just wanted to see if this worked, and it did, so here we are. 

It's taking most of my power not to look at other Jekyll themes and see if I like them better. But for now, that's a bit of a waste of time. Or even trying to switch to Hugo or Gatsby. 

Maybe one day, but for now, this is it.

Site's still under construction though... I'm not a web dev.[^1]

## But why?

Once, the internet would be full of sites like this. Usually about something random that the author was interested in. These days, I only find sites like that with developers and other online tech-people. This very theme was supposed to be for "technical writing," whatever that means.

I just want to have that little corner of the internet to myself. To ramble on about the things that I like.
